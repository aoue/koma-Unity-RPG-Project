It's the middle of the afternoon and hot.","\n","^Only recently founded, it's one of the many settlements that has sprung up in the past few years. They're usually backed by someone or organization in the Kingdom looking to expand their influence outwards.","\n","^Which is why although each settlement is a sizable risk, the prospect of wealth and power keep interests high. Agairy's own backing is obvious through the icons and emblems of the Virginal Order that abound.","\n","^The settlement's layout is a close-knit circle around a central area. Someone has cleared it, probably to prepare it for paving, but it remains beaten-down dirt for now.","\n","^The buildings are little more than shacks, which is well enough since they'll be torn down as the settlement grows, but at the far end of the square its largest building stands proudly.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Notice how the only stone building is the church. It's a message: this building is here to stay and don't you forget it.","\n","^If the settlement ever becomes anything greater, you can be sure it'll keep the Order's best interests at heart. Say what you will about them, but if there's one thing the Order has never lacked, it's foresight.","\n","^At least the settlers will have somewhere to hide if we make a mess of the exorcism.","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^They'd be safe in there?","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Certainly not. Anything that can get past the two of us will tear through a building quite happily.","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^I start to notice the people around us. Half-stooped in doorways, or standing in the square, the settlers are watching us silenty.","\n","^They've put down what they're doing. A man rests a full wheelbarrow on the ground and leans against the wall, a pair of women bearing buckets of water attached to yokes on their shoulders stand motionless beneath the weight.","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^They're staring at us.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^It would be strange if they weren't. We're probably the most interesting thing to show up here in months.","\n","ev","str","^Mc","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Really? What's so interesting about us?","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^She laughs. Some of the watching settler women are staring at Friday's dress.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Hmm, I wouldn't really know. City fashions? Maybe they've just gotten sick of looking at the same thirty faces every day.","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^There's definitely more than thirty people living here.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^What makes you say that?","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^The buildings. There could be easily a hundred people living in them.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Whether or not there's room for them, having that many people around would be more of a drain than anything else at this stage in the settlement's development. They don't want any extra mouthes to feed.","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^That makes a lot of empty buildings, then. We'll have somewhere to stay, I suppose.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Yes. The Order plans ahead. Once the settlement's become more established, they'll call for another group of settlers and so on. One group then the next, a bit bigger each time. In ten or twenty years, it could very well be its own little town.","\n","^But...","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Mother makes a show of looking around.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Shouldn't someone have come to meet us? Are we not important enough for them?","\n","^This is why I hate the sticks. Do you know, it's never once had the decency to change in 20 years. No matter where you go, it's been the same since I was a girl.","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Agairy didn't even exist 20 years ago.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^And yet it feel like I've been here a hundred times before.","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^I've learned not to take some of Mother's stronger opinions completely seriously.","\n","^Although I guess it's true that things move slower here. Not one of the settlers, still staring, has said a word. Not even a whisper to the person next to them.","\n","^Just then, the doors of the church open.","\n","^A woman walks out. Her role is immediately obvious from her clothing; An abbess in the Virginal Order. She looks as serene and graceful as one would expect for her position.","\n","^I can sense Mother's shoulders tensing next to me, ever so slightly. She gently places a hand on the small of my back, letting me know not to interrupt her.","\n","^The woman opens her mouth to speak, but Mother preempts her.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Sister Allowenn. How nice to see you again.","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Friday Cenparas, can it really be? What a pleasant surprise. I wonder why you've come all the way out here to humble Agairy?","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^For work, what else? One of the sisters here is ailing, the poor thing, but we're here to fix that.","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Oh, how splendid. And who is this young man accompanying you?","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^I open my mouth to introduce myself, but Mother places a hand on my back. She answers for me.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^My assistant. He's very promising. In fact, he had a theory while we coming here, if you'll indulge me.","\n","^... It might be a long shot but... could you be the one who's possessed, Sister Allowenn? It would explain a lot.","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Of course not. You musn't joke about such things, it has really been a most trying time for everyone here in the settlement.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Worth a try.","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Yes, ah- Please, let's talk inside. It doesn't do to speak of demons out-of-doors.","\n","^And by the way, not that it's important...","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Yes?","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^It is 'Abbess' Allowenn.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Is that right?

Still as stubborn as a mule and as much of a bitch as the dogs she resembles.","\n","^More, even. And then for some reason the Order's raised her up to an Abbess.","\n","ev","str","^Me","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^An abbess on the frontier, for thirty people. Is that really a promotion, or more like 'get out my hair.' You may not be the only one who dislikes her.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Ha, I suppose that's true. Of course I'm not jealous of her. I would even be happy for her if she wasn't such a... wasn't so hard to get along with.","\n","^Uh-huh. She's got nothing I want~","\n","^I have two beautiful daughters and an amazing son. I couldn't possibly be annoyed by her, it's simply impossible.","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^On the other hand, the Abbess is probably annoyed we're taking so long to follow her.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","ev",0,{"x()":"talk","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Okay.

How could you just let her slip away?","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Hmph! She did not just slip away. There was a Sister just outside her door at all times. Which was quite inconvenient... work has been trailing behind schedule because of her, I don't mind telling you.","\n","^For the short, very short, time she was left her unattended, the girl was far too sickly to even stand on her own. She was certainly in no condition to get up and walk from the church.","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^After we followed the Abbess inside, she shared some disconcerting news regarding the girl we had come here to help: She had gone missing early this morning.","\n","^When the Sister watching her had gone in to check on her and to bring her food and water, the possessed girl was in a bad way, sweating and gasping for breath. The attending Sister ran to fetch the Abbess but when they arrived back at the chamber, the girl was gone.","\n","^Mother shakes her head angrily. She seems far more upset at the news than the Abbess.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^You left her alone, of course she ran for it!","\n","^Ill? Of course not! Think for a moment!

When she speaks again, it's quietly and with resignation.","\n","ev","str","^Friday","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^She's being possessed. The demon won't kill her, but it'll go nearly there if it has reason to.","\n","^You don't take this seriously because she doesn't appear to be a monster. She still looks the same. There's no scales, or wings, or pointed tails to fear, and so we let our guards down.","\n","^But while there's a demon inside them, they are just as much of a threat, just as dangerous, as any other monster. They have no regard for any life besides their own and their host's. No inhibitions.","\n","^Humanity will learn this eventually... but not until more people have died.","\n","ev","str","^","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^The Abbess' frown has only curved further downwards as Mother spoke.","\n","ev","str","^Allowenn","/str",{"x()":"n","exArgs":1},"pop","/ev","\n","^Why, you speak as if you have all of life's answers.

That's why it ran. At the same time, it relies on others for its own survival.
