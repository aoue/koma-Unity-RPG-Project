Welcome to the (M ver.) Dear Friday to do list.
===========================================
ASSETS
screen dimensions: 1920x1080
event/move select portrait dimensions: (normal: 956x1599 | closeups: 650x1300) (1x2)
prepdungeonmenu unit icon/event preview portrait dimensions: 90x90 (1x1)
pdm/playerdungeon portrait dimensions: 500x250/450x225 (2x1) maybe enenacle for design? those are good.
enemy dungeon portrait dimensions: 450x200 (9x4)


DRAWING PROCESS:
- try this pipeline: lined paper -> scan -> draw outline digitally. Might yield better results.

SOME UI TO ADD:
- dungeon scene ui bg for the bottom of the screen box. should be somber, with like, carved angels in it.
- find a custom mouse pointer to use. they're fun.
- make notifier background image. 
	- like a wooden notice board? like a banner hanging down?
- make event icons; 
	- little flags: red, blue, and green.
- make proper 173x173 tiles. set ppu to 173x173 for them too.

GAME ART:
	- portraits for 
		- events (+expressions) and move selection
		- dungeon boxes
		- event previews/pdm selection(<- i think)
	- prologue overworld background; see notes
	- tile art
	- dungeon background image that goes behind the tiles
		- general trees and branches and bushes and stuff. same one for both dungeons.


===========================================
OGA licenses:
- you are required to follow only one of the licenses listed for a multi-licensed asset.

===== story dependent stuff
simplify, simplify.

===== end story dependent stuff

- the combat system IS good. it does have depth, and in a different way
  than a tactics game does. For instance, this game can do boss battles.
  For a game that focuses on monster fighting and stuff like that, having
  a system that allows good boss battles is super important.
- Further improvements to it do exist though. Like these, maybe:
	- hit%, dodge%
	- make duration for each stat individual; e.g. individual hp mod duration, ind physa dur, ind physd dur, etc
	- passives.
	- statuses redone and made individual. no one catch all duration thingie.
		- or rather, make duration for each stat individual; e.g. individual hp mod duration, ind physa dur, ind physd dur, etc

- a secondary combat system for large scale battles?
	- would be cool, it would let us include them as part of the story.
	- the combat system shouldn't be overly complicated. 
	- could even be realtime:
		- unit numbers go down every second they are in combat, order them to react, etc.
	- units would be groups of soldiers. You can assign party members to the group to give an effect.

========================================

- combat:
	- STAB?

- after clearing a dungeon:
	add a tag to parts with two options:
		- requires pass time press
		- automatically goes to next part
	only show pass time when it's required? right now it's always shown but only enabled when required.

- the overworld maps look like hand-drawn campaign maps of the area. They have markers for towns, armies, forests, etc.
	- brown canvas background. the event markers are little triangular flags stabbed down into the map.

- add center(mode) function to ink script files.

- dialogue canvas adjustments:
	- name text background; weird looking. just a black bar. look for insp somewhere, or use the ui set.
	- main text background; instead of black with alpha, try white with alpha.
	- on show(), make portrait slots match image size exactly.
	- on show(), include a parameter that sets order of portrait slot in scene

- dungeon design:
	- empty slots: a more suitable image. maybe something like an irregular circle of light? to show that something could be there.
	- background image: tiles go overtop.
	- scale room sizes up and remove rooms too. 
		- meaning: less empty rooms in between full rooms.
		- meaning: less busy walking.

- dungeon0 and dungeon1:
	- dungeon0 layout is ok. that boss fight is too much prob. make it just the boss.
	- dungeon1 layout needs to be made.

- sound manager:
	- footsteps sound.
	- move sounds
	- overworld music
	- dungeon music

- when we include assets (at the end):
	- moves sounds, music, sound effects, etc.
	remember to credit.
	OGA faq: https://opengameart.org/content/faq#q-ccgplcompat
	"What do the licenses mean"

- ui pack:
	- got one bookmarked from oga with a ton of things. try using it to make the ui look good.
		- dungeon ui needs to be resized too.
	- change the move preview menu too. (those three buttons, you know.)
	- a mouse cursor. just something stylized.

- sound manager:
	- sound effect for passing time. should be ~4 seconds long. doo doo doo doooooo ... doooo
	- footsteps sound: no good, it's too slow and is only 1 tap.
		- find a sound with multiple steps, 1 second long (or just over)

- main menu:
	- read file to get ic and playername. if no file, then create it.
		- if either ic or playername is different from default, then display them in the bottom right corner of the screen.
		- grad mc unit prefab and set nom to playername.
	Just make a fresh scene for mainmenu.
		- background image. (see bookmarked image. slowly scroll the image up.) 
		- start: scenemanager.load("overworld scene")
		- load (not interactable for now)
		- gallery (same scene as main menu. you click to load an event, which plays right there. post demo.)
		- exit: Application.Quit()

- save/load:
	- can only save on the overworld, in between events. save part, history (choices, not text), char progress, units, and gold. as little as possible.
	- on load should rejoin at the correct part, with same events displayed, party units states restored, etc.

- help sheet:
	Do last because things may change.
	- overworld, combat, and dungeon help sheets: displayed at first time of each. they are images. 
		- the help button can be pressed to show the help image at any time, depending on the scene.
	overworld tutorial:
	- explains colors/types of events.
		- red: story event; complete to continue
		- blue: day event; missable. you'll see these once only.
		- green: char event; available throughout entire game as long as character is present.
	- explain what ev preview means (char box, location, event title, haich)
	- explain what dungeon preview means (threat, exploration %, wanted monsters present)
	combat tutorial:
	- explain scheduling system. (instant, next turn, eor.) explain a killed unit cannot execute.
	- explain break system. (when a unit's break% reaches 100, they are broken. Only a unit with ap > 0 or a scheduled move can be broken. a broken unit has their break% set to 0, loses all their ap, and scheduled moves are cancelled. break% halves at the end of a turn.)
	- explain move row preference (front/back/ambi. wrong rows do 0nly 0.65x dmg) 
	- explain defender bonus (units in back row take only 0.75x dmg.)
	- explain turns. go back and forth until both sides have exhausted all unit's ap.
	- explain affinity. take note of the image representation, but exact multipliers are also available when targeting moves.
	- beware that moves may have strange effects
	- and that's all... you'll learn the rest by doing.
	dungeon help sheet:
	- explain that when entering an unexplored tile, all party units regain a bit of hp and mp.
	- explain about use_tile button. you can use it on any tile that has a sparkling effect on it, a little yellow thing.
		- remember you can only use each tile once.
	- you can drag the screen to move camera and hit recenter button to bring it back. also, scroll wheel zooms.
	- withdraw button: (note, clear tiles and home with exit tiles will be different visually)
		- you can withdraw from any tile with the door icon. 
		- but note that mandatory dungeons require you to clear them to progress the story.
			- a dungeon is only cleared when you withdraw through a cleartile. (show it)	
	- losing combat:
		- you can retry at no penalty as many times as you'd like. 
		- if you feel the battle is unwinnable, then you should hit the withdraw option instead.

- overworld menu options:
	- next to pass time button section, have these buttons: save, load
	- only appear when the mouse is in the top section of the screen.

- dialogue canvas:
	- it doesn't look very good. go and copy the layout of a good looking vn style dia canvas.
	VISUALS
	- the dialogue box image needs a frame image.
	- the name plate image needs a frame image too.


- idea for sabaind at large boss:
	- can have -ap self moves, maybe?

- update unity version?

===== Post Demo

- unit box layout: maybe.
	(see paper design)
	- hp and mp are two narrow bars along the bottom of the unit box, going the whole length of it.
		- both bars must have: value / value max.
	- break% is a vertical bar starting from top of hp bar and stopping at bottom of aff orb
		- must have the number in it. e.g. '35%'
	- aff orb placement is unchanged
	- in a vertical line below aff orb are ap dot images (4 total) which correspond to the unit's remaining ap
		- always present, but we hide/show them corresponding to the unit's current ap. apMax is 4.		


- one character's defend move:
	- dodge: -ap (i.e. next turn no ap.) totally immune to dmg.

- dialogue canvas:
	- increase the number of portraits. 5? that's probably good enough.
	portrait placement:
	- show function takes 2 additionnal arguments: 
		- float (0f - 1f) which determines where the image is shown on the x axis of the canvas screen.
		- z order, so we can control showing. e.g. luci stands in front of ganat (and a bit to the side, too)

- combat controls:
	(low priority)
	you should be able to play entirely with keyboard:
	- order a unit: (by tile) numbers 1-6
	- pick a move: 1-5, 0 for defend.
	- pick a target: (by tile) numbers 1-6

- should we consider some kind of guard ability? i guess.
	(post demo)
	here's how it would work:
	- apply it as a status to a unit. set the user of the status move as the guarder field of the target.
	- when a unit with guarded != null. after damage and break are calculated, but before dealing them to the guarded unit,
	  check if the unit is being guarded. if it is, then send dmg and break to our guarding unit.
	- if the guarding unit is broken, then their guard ends.
	- if the guarding unit is put ooa, then their guard ends too.

- character events:
	- make sure they have field where they have a minimum part reached for each event.
	(or you could just store it in a parallel int array. whatever's easiest)

- event type:
	- remove certain party member by unit id.

- mob parties:
	- if a mob party has a loss event, then add a visual indicator to their flag icon. the haich heart works.

- dungeon withdrawal:
	- penalty for withdrawing on a loss: you only bring 50% loot and exp with you or something.
	needs a change because right now 'withdraw' and 'loss' are the same.

- combat:
	(you have to buy the license for this)
	- surrender button. instantly loses the battle.

- interesting moves:
	- for a character like sincy, some of her drain moves do more dmg against males. this would require adding a gender enum to all units. (which is fine.)

- dungeon unit box:
	(future -- post demo at least)
	- unit ui layout:
		- aff and name: unchanged.
		- ap text: top left, just below aff and name.
		- hpbar along bottom left (include letters overtop)
		- mpbar below hpbar (include letters overtop)

- more status to add:
	- make a unit's dmg spread get the highest/lowest possible roll. (2 stances)

- guild store:
	run by ??. each time you enter in a part, it displays a unique part text on the left with moth's character icon.
		e.g. "remember to report fences, black markets, or any other illegal transactions that violate the guild's exclusive commercial rights in Cherespoir. :)"
	- on the right two thirds is the list of things to buy and the buy a thing button in two columns.
	  things can only be bought once OR can be bought a certain number of times.
	can buy:
	- surrender permit | allows the player to surrender and instantly lose a battle.
	- dungeon permit - NAME | allows the player to enter a new dungeon, NAME. 
	- healing charge license - I to V | increases number of healing charges you have. from 1 at I to 5 at V.
	- healing techniques - I to X | increase percentage of unit hpmax healed when using a healing charge. start at 50% at I to 100% at X
	- explorer's license - I to V? | increases percentage of hp and mp regenerated when entering an unexplored tile.
	- explorer's pamphlet - TYPE | makes tiles of TYPE (e.g. font of health) start visible in a dungeon. not all tile types, of course.
	- logistics I to X | can buy multiple times for increasing price. increases base stamina by a small number. 2? 3? 5?
	- sponsors I to X? | increases the threat floor of all dungeons. (meaning the dungeon's threat never goes below a certain number)
	- special contract - EXP | for the next dungeon, receive no gold, but double exp. locks special contract Gold.
	- special contract - GOLD | for the next dungeon, receive no exp, but double gold. locks special contract exp.

- guild hall:
	run by ??. each time you enter in a part, displays unique part text, etc, etc same as guild store.
		e.g. "The guild waives all responsibility for loss of limb or life."
	interface is the same layout as guild store, but products are different.
	it's more like a bounty thing. you do things playing and you may be eligible for a reward.
	- maintains a list of wanted monsters, with name and location(what dungeon they're in). kill it and then click redeem button to obtain the reward.
	- maintains a list of optional dungeons and your exploration % in them. bring exploration to 100% to receive a reward.
