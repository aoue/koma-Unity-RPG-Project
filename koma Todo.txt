Welcome to the (M ver.) Dear Friday to do list.
===========================================
ASSETS
NOTE: draw at desired image dimensions on the tablet (or at some factor) and fill the whole image.
NOTE: draw a skeleton as one layer, then copy it as the base for each drawing.
screen dimensions: 1920x1080
full portrait dimensions: 540x1080 (1x2)
event preview portrait dimensions: 90x90 (1x1)
pdm/playerdungeon portrait dimensions: 500x250/450x225 (2x1) maybe enenacle for design? those are good.
enemy dungeon portrait dimensions: 450x200 (9x4)
move select portrait: 540x1080. reuse full portrait.

use a thick brush, it looks better.
- dungeon scene ui bg for the bottom of the screen box. should be somber, with like, carved angels in it.
- find a custom mouse pointer to use. they're fun.
- new sprites for the new cast. full portrait and box portraits too. use the exact size drawing canvas for the image.
	confirm dimensions before starting. make a template so that everyone is on the same scale.
	- 540x1080 full portraits can be waist up (just check some vns, see what they do.) 
	- 90x90 box portraits can be minimalist. (include an unknown one, with a ?)
	- 250x500 combat portraits should have the face over more on the left side.
- make notifier background image. (should look like a wooden notice board, with thick borders. maybe there's one free online.)
- make event icons; red, blue, and green.
- make proper 173x173 tiles. set ppu to 173x173 for them too.
- compass image for the dungeon. rotate the compass image just like the other sprites. how cool it is.

===========================================
PROGRAMMING
use drag and drop for assigning gear, moves, positions in formation, etc

Okay, okay, but what do we need for the demo/prologue to be released?
(in no particular order)

===== story dependent stuff

grow up? as if he did.

- visuals:
	finish planning before starting to draw something.
	once the plan is done, then we can start making all the visuals. we will need:
	- overworld background, complete with all the buildings we'll need.
	- dungeon bar background. it needs something, not just the plain gray background. darkest dungeon has something like it i think.
	- full portraits and expressions.
	- combat portraits for party units and for enemy units.
	- scene backgrounds.
	- scene images.
	- unique tile images for dungeon tiles.
	- event icons. make them flags that stick out of the buildings or something.
	- event preview portraits

- figure out what drawings are needed:
	- do this once all events are written and all mobs are created.)

===== end story dependent stuff

we are not going to redo the combat system, it is kind of fun. :) just leave it or you'll never finish anything lol.
=====
- the overworld bgs should have some animation. (even just weather, like rain or wind.)
- Note: specific events in character chains may also be locked to the world's part level. 
	(- No chains are available in the prologue.)

-----

- dungeon design: (to keep in mind)
	- mob parties must absolutely not start on a home tile. 
	- be careful to make it so the player never becomes stuck in a dungeon. they must always be able to withdraw.
	- mandatory dungeons, once cleared, you can never go back in. they're roadblocks.
	- optional dungeons, you don't even 'clear' them. they have no clear tile.
		- you can go in them as many times as you want, until the dungeon becomes unavailable, usually at an act change.
		- if doing something in an optional dungeon is necessary for a sidequest or something (like a recruitment quest or a monster slaying quest)
		  then triggering an event will mark something in history that the event back in overworld checks.

- writing:
	- copy in an old file from arti; need all the ink functions/vars again.
	- remember to include ic and name var again. (read ic same way, from a text file in the save loc folder.)
		- uncomment vars in eventManager, etc.
	- create prologue skeleton
	- write events... bit by bit.

- pdm:
	- no where does it display a unit's hp, lol. what an oversight.
	- can display it in unitbox, i suppose.

- sound manager:
	footsteps sound: no good, it's too slow and is only 1 tap.
	- find a sound with multiple steps, 1 second long (or just over)

- dungeon tiles:
	- font of stamina is still okay; but make it only give a little stamina to party's pooledstamina.
	- new tile: font of mp (restore some portion of each party unit's mp.)

- dungeon scene:
	- stamina heal: must take at least 1 stam.
	- retry manager: update it to save and fill unit's mp alongside hp. also... does it really work properly?

- play by play:
	- when displaying: "unit prepares to use ___ next turn" remove 'next turn', same for 'at end of round'
	  or whatever.
	- the time it will be used is obvious from the move previews, which the player will be able to check 
	  momentarily.

- dungeon unit box:
	(future)
	- unit ui layout:
		- aff and name: unchanged.
		- ap text: top left, just below aff and name.
		- hpbar along bottom left (include letters overtop)
		- mpbar below hpbar (include letters overtop)

- unit stat previews:
	- keep an eye out for places where the old stamina text needs to be replaced for the new stamina text system.

- dungeon:
	- add stamina check when enabling dungeon movement arrows.
		- implemented; now just make sure it's accurate.


- dungeon + SM:
	- play footsteps sound through SM. (need to test it. played in a new tile, stopped in slide listener.)
	- if it's an unexplored tile:
		- restore a little (5%?) of each party unit's hp.

- dungeon 0:
	- plan it out. 
	- mobs? various Sabaind. (designs are still in the sheet, at least)
	- party? Mc, Friday, Nat, and Tori. (mc is a combat character now. a balance mage, i guess. keep moves same, but make him normal aff i guess)(designs still in the sheet too -- but change them some. e.g. tori's flourish -> flash steel. a weak, but instant move.)
		- rescale design sheet stats. (hp mostly, but some atk for mobs.)

- exp:
	- now that monsters actually have exp, is it being carried back properly?

- filling out dungeon hover:
	- title, current threat
	- symbol if: mandatory and not yet cleared.
	- symbol if optional and not yet cleared.
	- symbol if entered before.

- main menu: (no need to worry about loading, dude. we're not going to implement that.)
	Just make a fresh scene for mainmenu.
		- start: scenemanager.load("overworld scene")
		- load (not interactable for now)
		- exit: Application.Quit()

- when we include assets (at the end):
	- moves, music, sounds, etc.
	remember to credit.
	OGA faq: https://opengameart.org/content/faq#q-ccgplcompat
	"What do the licenses mean"

- ui pack:
	- got one bookmarked from oga with a ton of things. try using it to make the ui look good.
		- dungeon ui needs to be resized too.
	- change the move preview menu too. (those three buttons, you know.)
	- a mouse cursor. just something stylized.

- sound effect for passing time. should be ~4 seconds long. doo doo doo doooooo ... doooo

===== Post Demo

- unit trees:
	these let you customize and level up each unit. can: increase level, exchange moves, and do gear(?).
	MOVE TREE
	the unit's name is in the center of the screen and each of their starting moves goes in a direction. four move paths by default.
	- to learn a move, you must click it, then click learn move. 
		- when you highlight a move its info will be filled out.
		- when you click a move, its info will be locked and the learn button is enabled (if you pass requirements).
		- you must have gold and exp fee.
		- you must have learned ALL of the move's predecessors. a move can have many.
		- you must be the required level to learn the move. moves have a minimum learn level.
	- when showing a move:
		- use lines to show move predecessors
		- learned moves have solid boxes, learnables have dotted boxes. unlearnables have no boxes.
			- the predecessor lines follow the same pattern.
	I suppse that, because of predecessors, etc, each unit must have their own version of the tree.	
	CLICKED MOVE
	the move's preview area. 
		- has a locked version (shown on moveslot unhover, locked on click) 
		- has a LEARN button for learneable moves when they are clicked. also displays the exp cost and gold cost to learn the move.
	UNIT PART
	the unit's preview area. you can see the name, aff, and stat block.
		- near it, there's the level up button. it shows the cost in exp.
		- press the button to level up the unit. leveling up the unit shows a popup of how the unit improved itself.
	when level up button is pressed (only enabled if you can afford it):
		- increase level by 1.
		- increase each stat by a value taken from a very small range.
			- a unit at the same level across games will always have very similar stats, but not identical.
	MOVE SLOTS
	at the bottom, the unit's 5 move slots are filled out.
		- the player can drag a learned move from the tree into one of the move slots to equip moves.
		- when trying to equip, check to make sure the move (using id) is not already equipped.
	MECHANICS
	so these are the decisions the player makes: level up or moves -> if moves, then which move.
	offsets: if early moves are cheaper, then the player will just buy them up.
		possible countermeasures:
		- every time the player learns a move, the cost of learning every other move goes up by 5%?
		- the cost of learning a move is increased by the player's level?


- saving and loading: (not in demo)
	keep it simple.
	- party members' states.(stats, equipped moves, and unlocked reserve moves.) 
	- unspent exp or items
	- history. (a record of the significant choices the player has made during the game)
	- day (which lets us pick ourselves back up in a load very easily)

- cart:
	- it strikes me that, just like for party units, we could create a prefab for the cart
	  and then just make changes to that prefab, which would be saved given the nature of a prefab.
	  Seems like a much cleaner way to carry data between scenes.

- more status to add:
	- make a unit's dmg spread get the highest/lowest possible roll. (2 stances)

- guild store:
	run by moth. each time you enter in a part, it displays a unique part text on the left with moth's character icon.
		e.g. "remember to report fences, black markets, or any other illegal transactions that violate the guild's exclusive commercial rights in Cherespoir. :)"
	- on the right two thirds is the list of things to buy and the buy a thing button in two columns.
	  things can only be bought once OR can be bought a certain number of times.
	can buy:
	- dungeon license - NAME | allows the player to enter a new dungeon, NAME. 
	- healing license - I to X? | improves stamina to hp healing percent in dungeon heal button. starts at I = 1%, ends at X = 10%.
	- stamina license - I to X? | same as healing license, but for unit's stamina.
	- explorer's pamphlet - TYPE | makes tiles of TYPE (e.g. font of health) start visible in a dungeon. not all tile types, of course.
	- logistics I to X | can buy multiple times for increasing price. increases base stamina by a small number. 2? 3? 5?
	- dogtags I to X? | increases the threat floor of all dungeons. (meaning the dungeon's threat never goes below a certain number)
	- special contract - EXP | for the next dungeon, receive no gold, but double exp. locks special contract Gold.
	- special contract - GOLD | for the next dungeon, receive no exp, but double gold. locks special contract exp.

- guild hall:
	run by tori. each time you enter in a part, displays unique part text, etc, etc same as guild store.
		e.g. "The guild waives all responsibility for loss of limb or life."
	interface is the same layout as guild store, but products are different.
	it's more like a bounty thing. you do things playing and you may be eligible for a reward.
	- maintains a list of wanted monsters, with name and location(what dungeon they're in). kill it and then click redeem button to obtain the reward.
	- maintains a list of optional dungeons and your exploration % in them. bring exploration to 100% to receive a reward.
