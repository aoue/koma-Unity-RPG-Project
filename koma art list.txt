keeping track of planned art for Ink.
format:
name - description
==========================================
for prologue, we need:
(note that some units will be duplicates, e.g. deaconess is npc + enemy unit)

OVERWORLD
- single overworld image for the town (Agairy?) is fine.

DUNGEON TILES
- a unique image for each tile prefab

PARTY UNITS
- friday portrait + variants
- mc portrait (combat only)
- moth portrait + variants. Note, in prologue moth will be wearing sister clothes.
- hunter portrait + variants

ENEMY UNITS
- sabaind-at-large
- sabaind warrior
- sabaind skirmisher
- wolf
- qegmer
- settler

NPCS
- deaconess portrait + variants

SCENES: (see notes, scattered)
- sc0: sabaind-at-large + Moth, at cave
- sc1: friday + mc, at festival
- sc2: artifact's tentacles + two settler girls? (one unconscious, one who wakes up during)




==========================================
(only add ones that have been used explicitly. for char images, each will have 2 versions, at near/far zooms)
