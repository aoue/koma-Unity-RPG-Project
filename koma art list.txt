keeping track of planned art for Ink.
format:
name - description
==========================================
for prologue, we need:
(note that some units will be duplicates, e.g. deaconess is npc + enemy unit)

OVERWORLD
- single overworld image for the town (Agairy?) is fine.

EVENTS BACKGROUNDS
(OUTDOORS)
note, outdoors backgrounds should be reuseable.
- plains road with a few trees in the background. lightly wooded.
- forest. no path, trees. stuff are on the ground. some light peeking through.
- cave. got your stalegtites/mites, rocks, etc. a bat sleeping in one corner.
(AGAIRY)
note, agairy backgrounds have the emblem and other icons of the virginal order present. what's the emblem? a woman's thighs closed together.
- agairy town square (part 1 event 1). church and other buildings are visible in the bg.
- agairy church. pews, stone building. there's a visible door to the back room.
- agairy church room. A bed in there, with adj chair, and moth is laying in in, asleep. stone walls, same as rest of church.
(CITIES)
- inn room. a basic room, we'll be using it in like every city. bed, dresser, etc.

DUNGEON TILES
- a unique image for each tile prefab

- sabaind-at-large
- sabaind warrior
- sabaind skirmisher
